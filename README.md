the QoE dataset， videos have been uploaded to Google Drive the link: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mFytmSLLfnOv7nVS31fJIrLnmsMMRdsI/view?usp=sharing 

the .xlsx files are named by videoname+x+y, videoname represents the name of the video, x represents the total time of rebuffering in the video，y represents the total times of rebuffering in the video;
for example, sport42 means the video named sport has rebuffered 4 seconds while playing, each time of rebuffering lasts 2 seconds.
